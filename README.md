This notebook aims at automating the loan approval decision for the loan approval dataset: https://rb.gy/2uv52l. This was performed on five stages:
1. Data Cleaning and pre-processing of the dataset.
2. Feature Extraction and selection (Using PCA for dimensionality reduction)
3. Applying Unsupervised Learning approaches (clustering techniques: K-means, and k-medoids)
4. Applying Supervised Learning approaches (classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation and comparison metrices (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score)
